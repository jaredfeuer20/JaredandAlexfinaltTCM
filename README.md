We are creating a ping pong game
We want to be able to use the mouse to control the ping pong paddle 
We want the ball to recognize when it hits a paddle and then moves in the respective direction
If the ball goes off the screen then it we want a point to generate for the hitter
Would be cool if we figure out how to make user be able to play against computer or another user
